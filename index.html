<i>"Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards, and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little 'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon, and hanging in the misty clouds."</i><br>
-Charles Dickens, <i>Bleak House</i>

<div class="text" id="intro" style="width:100%; margin:auto; position: relative;">
<p>Air pollution in London is nothing new. The city has struggled with <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00022470.1976.10470341">poor air quality for almost 800 years</a>, ever since people started burning coal. But despite Dickens' depiction of London's fog as an egalitarian, if cruel, phenomenon, it has long been the poor who have suffered disproportionately from the capital's filthy air.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_26-1-2015-12-17-52">2015 study by researchers at Imperial College</a> found that ethnic minorities and communities of social deprivation were the hardest hit by air pollution, and that this disparity was more pronounced in London than anywhere else in the UK.</p>
<p>The map below displays that grim reality, with London's affordable housing developments clustered around some of the city's most polluted roads. As <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollutions-mps-committees-inquiry-government-inaction-sued-fossil-fuel-emissions-a7640406.html">MPs launch a massive inquiry into air pollution</a>, you can now explore the extent of the city's problem. Type in the name of the road you live on, or your cycle route to work. Click on any highlighted road to see emission levels, or on a blue marker to see how many affordable homes there are on the site.</p>

 <p>Affordable Housing data was taken from <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/increasing-housing-supply/affordable-housing-statistics">the Greater London Authority</a>, which started collecting information on affordable housing completions in 2011 and stopped in 2014. As a result, this is far from a comprehensive collection of all London's affordable housing. It is intended as a very large sample size to indicate a general trend. Scheme level data on the locations of affordable housing has not been collected in the UK outside London.</p>
 <p>Data on air pollution is from modelled roadside pollution data, <a href="https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/library/no2ten/2015-no2-projections-from-2013-data">released by the Department of Energy, Farming and Rural Affairs</a>.</p>
